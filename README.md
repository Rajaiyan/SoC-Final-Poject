# SoC Final Project

Requirement: Installing Ubuntu

# First Section
Download all file in folder with name of First Section. A program is written in Python language for scheduling. This program has been tested and its function is correct. In this part of the project, you only have to learn how to install modules and how to run the program. After a few simple searches, you will easily get the necessary commands to run this program.
After running the program, the following figure should be displayed.
<div align="center">
  <img align="center" src="First Section/First Section.png" width="500px" />
  <figcaption><b><br>Figure 1: First Section.</b></figcaption>
</div>


Run an arbitrary scheduling for 10 task and provide the result in the report. 


# Second Section
Download all file in folder with name of Second Section. A program is written in Python language for Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). 

How to run it?

You should flow the four step below:

first: write the below comman in terminal.
```sh
source ACO_project/bin/activate
```

second: write the below comman in terminal.
```sh
source ACO_project/bin/activate
```

third: Use the experience you gained in the First Section to install the required modules.
```sh
Use the experience you gained in the First Section to install the required modules.
```

Fourth: Run the main program.

After running the program, the following figures should be displayed.
<div align="center">
  <img align="center" src="Second Section/results/ACO_cycles_results.png" width="500px" />
  <figcaption><b><br>Figure 2: Second Section.</b></figcaption>
</div>

<div align="center">
  <img align="center" src="Second Section/results/execution_gantt.png" width="500px" />
  <figcaption><b><br>Figure 3: Second Section.</b></figcaption>
</div>



Take a screenshot of the results you get and put it in the report. Also give a brief explanation about ACO in your report.


# Third Section

In this section you should practice how to change other people's codes. To do this part of the project, try to change the Second Section program in such a way that the timing in Figure 3 changes. Explain your solution in the report and also put pictures of the new results. One of the possible changes is that the output of the program is changed from Figure 3 to Figure 4. Pay attention to the differences between these two Figures. You can also get your unique output.

<div align="center">
  <img align="center" src="Third Section/Figure_4.png" width="500px" />

</div>


# Fourth Section

Write a program in Python language that receives the number of tasks, task name, task arrival time and the time required to execute the task as input from the user and displays the scheduling of the tasks in the output using the First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First method (SJF). Be careful that the results should only be displayed in the Ubuntu terminal and avoid designing a graphical user interface.

# Fifth Section

In addition to submitting a project report, each student must create a repository on github and share the codes and results they have obtained. Record the repository address in the project report. Having a suitable and productive profile on github can help a lot in your future career.
